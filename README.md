# 👋 Hi there, I'm Yuri Pirola

🎓 I'm an assistant professor at DISCo, University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan) working on computational problems arising from 📈 large quantities of data now available in Bioinformatics.

🌱 My main interests involve the study of the computational complexity of optimization problems, the design of exact/approximation/parameterized algorithms for their resolution, and their implementation and experimentation.

⬇️ Check my repos and the repos I contribute to if you are curious to see what I'am working on.
